# veterinary-website
The aim of this project is to develop a website that will assist with adoptions and the CTSO. The problem that was identified is that the veterinary industry lacks a platform to advertise their adoptions and usually sends emails with descriptions, videos, and pictures. This is where I come in to create a website that does this and more.
